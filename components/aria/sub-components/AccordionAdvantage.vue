            ARIA can test for over 120+ analytes. ARIA provides extensive testing for pain management, natural/semi-synthetic/synthetic opioids & opiates, antipsychotics, illicits (like MDMA, PCP, Ketamine & THC) and upon request designer drugs (like synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, etc). ARIA offers Presumptive and Definitive assays to ensure the most comprehensive and accurate testing available. Our assays are continually updated as new drugs are introduced or usage of a particular drug spikes. ARIA uses Liquid Chromatography coupled with Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to ensure any positive or unexpected presumptive tests are verified for accuracy and cross-reactivity. Our clients rely on accurate results to implement thorough compliance adherence so ARIA believes in utilizing the highest quality equipment and standards. Any immunoassay presumptive test that reads positive or unexpected should be verified using additional technology like GC-MS, LC-MS or LC-MS/MS. At ARIA we use LC-MS/MS to ensure better specificity and precision identification. LC-MS/MS quantitates more drugs and metabolites, with greater accuracy by analyzing mass and structure.

            ARIA Diagnostics combines Presumptive Immunoassay testing with Definitive LC-MS/MS testing to ensure the most accurate analysis possible. Following the specimen analyses, ARIA will certify the laboratory results. Results are reviewed to identify any false or unexpected results as well as uncovering any cross-reactivity interference from structurally similar substances. ARIA applies CAP standards to our Quality Control and Quality Assurance, documenting throughout testing to help physiciansâ€™ confidently and accurately maximize compliance and mitigate risk.
